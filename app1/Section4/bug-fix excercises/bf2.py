# The programmer is again missing something in the code. Try to find what it is and fix it.
# code below:

# buttons = ["cancel", "reply", "submit"]
#
# for i in buttons:
# print(i.capitalize())

buttons = ["cancel", "reply", "submit"]

for i in buttons:
    print(i.capitalize())
    # print function was not indented properly, added indentation so code executes
