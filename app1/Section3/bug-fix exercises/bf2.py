# The programmer here is trying to convert the string "hello" to "HELLO" by using the upper() method:
# code below:

# greeting = "hello"
# print(upper(greeting))

# However, the program returns an error. Can you help fix the code, so it prints out HELLO?

greeting = "hello"
print(greeting.upper())
# added greeting variable before the upper function, so the upper function is correctly called
